# image_classifier
This was a task given by Slash company where three categories 'Accessories'&amp; 'Fashion'&amp;' and Nutrition' images were classified using Machine Learning techniques such as SVM &Random forest. As the dataset wasn't sufficiently big enough data augmentation was implemented to execute CNN but the model accuracy enhancement is a topic to be studied later. Firstly, data was imported from a zip file and classified into train and test and the data was stratified to divide members of the population into homogeneous before sampling then Synthetic Minority over sampling technique was applied as there was an imbalance in the dataset scoring only 70%. Afterward, Random forest regression was applied and the train sets were resampled once more it enhanced the dataset to score 90%. Augmenting the data by applying techniques such as rescaling,rotating, and shifting the height. Finally, optimizing and applying learning rate scheduler to adjust the learning rate between epochs and iteration but still, this technique must be enhanced as the accuracy of the epoch is still questionable
